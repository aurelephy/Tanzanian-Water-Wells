# Tanzanian-Water-Wells
## Business Understanding
Tanzania struggles with providing clean water to its population, particularly in rural areas where access to safe drinking water and well-maintenance are significant issues. These challenges often result from a combination of limited infrastructure, funding constraints, and the harsh environmental conditions that affect the sustainability of water sources 
## Goal of the project 
The goal is to use data from existing wells throughout the country to identify the wells in need of repair. This analysis is focused on assisting the Tanzanian Government reduce resources spent to identify water wells that need repair to ensure that clean water is available to its citizens.

### Main Objective 
This analysis is focused on assisting the Tanzanian Government reduce resources spent to identify water wells that need repair to ensure that clean water is available to its citizens.
### Specific Objective
to analyze the functionality of the existing water wells
## Data Understanding 
To better understand the data, I have reviewed the features and separated them into numerical and categorical feature types:

**Numerical:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `amount_tsh` - Total static head (amount water available to waterpoint)
- `gps_height` - Altitude of the well
- `longitude` - GPS coordinate
- `latitude` - GPS coordinate
- `num_private` - Number private
- `population` - Population around the well
- `construction_year` - Year the waterpoint was constructed

**Categorical:**
- `installer` - Organization that installed the well
- `wpt_name` - Name of the waterpoint if there is one
- `basin` - Geographic water basin
- `subvillage` - Geographic location
- `lga` - Geographic location
- `ward` - Geographic location
- `public_meeting` - True/False
- `scheme_management` - Who operates the waterpoint
- `permit` - If the waterpoint is permitted
- `extraction_type` - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- `extraction_type_group` - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- `extraction_type_class` - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- `management` - How the waterpoint is managed
- `management_group` - How the waterpoint is managed
- `payment` - What the water costs
- `payment_type` - What the water costs
- `water_quality` - The quality of the water
- `quality_group` - The quality of the water
- `quantity` - The quantity of water
- `quantity_group` - The quantity of water
- `source` - The source of the water
- `source_type` - The source of the water
- `source_class` - The source of the water
- `waterpoint_type` - The kind of waterpoint
- `waterpoint_type_group` - The kind of waterpoint
- `region_code` - Geographic location (coded)
- `district_code` - Geographic location (coded)
- `scheme_name` - Who operates the waterpoint 
- `date_recorded` - The date the row was entered
- `funder` - Who funded the well
- `region` - Geographic location
- `recorded_by` - Group entering this row of data
- `target` - The current status of the waterpoint
## Data Preparation 
Under data preparation, I did the following:
   - Data cleaning by dropping unwanted columns
   - addressing missing values
   - setting up pipelines

## Methodology
This analysis has run 10 models to predict Tanzanian Water Wells in need of repair. Several factors were taken into consideration in choosing a final model:
- Accuracy
    - How accurate is the model?
- ROC-AUC score
    - How does the model perform when looking at true positive rates and true negative rates?
- Fit and Run Time
    - How long does the model take to fit and predict the data?
The methodology I used for building the model were:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
       - K-Means
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - C-Support Vector Classification (SVC)
   - Nu-Support Vector Classification (NuSVC)
   - AdaBoost
   - XGBoost
   - Stack Classification Methods

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, improving water well infrastructure in Tanzania requires a focused and strategic approach. By enhancing well technology, prioritizing year-round water availability, and investing in communal standpipe wells, the country can make significant strides in addressing water access challenges. Concentrating efforts in high-need regions such as Lindi and Mtwara ensures that resources are directed where they are most needed.

Deploying and refining predictive models will further augment traditional methods of identifying wells in need of repair, leading to more efficient use of resources. While the model may not be perfect, its integration promises a significant reduction in costs and manpower requirements, making well-maintenance more sustainable.

Ultimately, these efforts will result in improved water access for Tanzanian citizens, enhancing health, well-being, and overall quality of life. With a commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation, Tanzania can ensure a brighter future for its communities through reliable and sustainable water supply systems.
Based on the evaluation of various regression and classification models, it is evident that machine learning algorithms can effectively predict the condition of waterpoints in Tanzania.
